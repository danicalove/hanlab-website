    <h3>Dr. Ruiqi Han (韩瑞琦)</h3>
    <p class="leader-title">Principal Investigator & Group Leader</p>
    <p class="leader-description">
      Professor Ruiqi Han obtained her Bachelor's degree in Life Sciences from Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands (2007-2011), followed by a Master's degree in Cancerology from the University of Amsterdam (2011-2013). In 2013, she joined the team of Academician Reuven Agami at the Netherlands Cancer Institute for her doctoral research on the systematic relationship between gene transcription regulation and protein translation efficiency. During this period, she pioneered the development of CRISPR screening methods targeting the non-coding genome and enhancers. In 2019, she began her postdoctoral research at the Institute of Developmental Biology and Stem Cell Research of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, focusing on 3D genome regulation and cohesin-related studies. Her research findings have been published in international journals such as Cell, Nature Biotechnology, Molecular Cell, and Genome Biology. In 2025, she joined the Modern Institute of Biology at Nanjing University to establish a laboratory dedicated to genome structure regulation.
