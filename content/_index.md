## Research Overview

Our lab is interested in understanding how three-dimensional genome organization controls gene expression and cellular function. We use cutting-edge molecular biology, genomics, and computational approaches to study:

- **Chromatin Architecture**: How chromatin loops and topological domains regulate gene expression
- **Cohesin Complex**: The role of cohesin in maintaining chromosome structure,transcription, cancer,DNA damage and celluar function  
- **RNA Modifications**: m6A methylation and its impact on gene expression and disease
- **Epigenetic Regulation**: Histone modifications and their role in development and disease
- **CRISPR screening library**: Establish a CRISPR screening library to discover new cancer therapeutic targets.
