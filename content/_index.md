## Research Overview

Our lab is interested in understanding how three-dimensional genome organization controls gene expression and cellular function. We use cutting-edge molecular biology, genomics, and computational approaches to study:

- **Chromatin Architecture**: How chromatin loops and topological domains regulate gene expression
- **Cohesin Complex**: The role of cohesin in maintaining chromosome structure and gene regulation  
- **RNA Modifications**: m6A methylation and its impact on gene expression and disease
- **Epigenetic Regulation**: Histone modifications and their role in development and disease

## Recent Highlights

- Published breakthrough research on STAG2-mediated chromatin interactions in *Nature Cell Biology*
- Discovered novel mechanisms of m6A modification in cancer progression
- Developed innovative computational tools for 3D genome analysis
- Established collaborative networks with leading international research institutions

## Research Focus

韩瑞琦实验室主要研究方向包括三维基因组组织调控、cohesin复合体功能、RNA表观遗传修饰以及相关疾病机制。我们致力于利用多学科交叉方法揭示基因调控的分子机制。
